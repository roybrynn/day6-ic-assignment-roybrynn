## [Explanation](why_do_we_need_functions.md)

The Explanation page dives deeper into the importance of functions in Python and how these example functions serve the purpose of teaching key concepts. 

Functions are extremely important to developing Python code. Even simple examples—like [`my_adder`](adder.md)—teach key concepts:

* Reusability: Functions can be called multiple times without needing to rewrite entire paragraphs of code.

* Readability: Functions reduce repeated lines of code, and the name defines a clear use of the function

* Organization: Functions break programs into pieces, each with a set purpose.

Starting with simple cases like the functions in this repository ensures beginners understand the structure of functions (def, parameters, return values) before creating more complicated pieces of code.
