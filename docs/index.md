# Welcome to Python Example Functions

This documentation site contains a detailed explanation, source code, and examples for a set of different functions. These are very simple functions that can be used in learning how to code in Python. 

## The Functions:

Below is a list of the different functions to be reviewed in this documentation. 

* [`my_adder`](adder.md) - Summation function.
* [`has_digits`](digits.md) - Checks for digits within a string.
* [`my_thermostat`](thermostat.md) - Imitates the function of a thermostat.


The documentation follows the best practice for project documentation as described by Daniele Procida in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/).

## [Tutorials](grouped_example.md)

Tutorials is the place to start implementing these functions in Python. It covers an example use case for each function.

## [How-To-Guide](parameter_explanations.md)

The How-To-Guide dives deeper into the types of things you can do with each function to gain experience in Python. It generally explains the parameters and the range of possible use cases for each function.

## [Explanation](why_do_we_need_functions.md)

The Explanation page dives deeper into the importance of functions in Python and how these example functions serve the purpose of teaching key concepts. 

## [Reference](adder.md)

The References provide a detailed set of inputs, outputs, and source code for each function.
